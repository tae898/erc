At the moment, we only use the text modality to correctly classify the emotion of the utterances.The experiments were carried out on two datasets (i.e. MELD and IEMOCAP)

## Prerequisites

1. An x86-64 Unix or Unix-like machine
1. Python 3.8 or higher
1. Running in a virtual environment (e.g., conda, virtualenv, etc.) is highly recommended so that you don't mess up with the system python.
1. [`multimodal-datasets` repo](https://github.com/tae898/multimodal-datasets) (submodule)
1. pip install -r requirements.txt

## EmoBERTa training

First configure the hyper parameters and the dataset in `train-erc-text.yaml` and then,
In this directory run the below commands. I recommend you to run this in a virtualenv.

```sh
python train-erc-text.py
```

This will subsequently call `train-erc-text-hp.py` and `train-erc-text-full.py`.

## Results on the test split (weighted f1 scores)

| Model    |                                 |   MELD    |  IEMOCAP  |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: |
| EmoBERTa | No past and future utterances   |   63.46   |   56.09   |
|          | Only past utterances            |   64.55   | **68.57** |
|          | Only future utterances          |   64.23   |   66.56   |
|          | Both past and future utterances | **65.61** |   67.42   |
|          | â†’ _without speaker names_       |   65.07   |   64.02   |

Above numbers are the mean values of five random seed runs.

If you want to download the trained checkpoints and stuff, then [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/khREwk4MUI7MSnO/download) is where you can download them. It's a pretty big zip file.

## Deployment

### Huggingface

We have released our models on huggingface:

- [emoberta-base](https://huggingface.co/tae898/emoberta-base)
- [emoberta-large](https://huggingface.co/tae898/emoberta-large)

They are based on [RoBERTa-base](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) and [RoBERTa-large](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large), respectively. They were trained on [both MELD and IEMOCAP datasets](utterance-ordered-MELD_IEMOCAP.json). Our deployed models are neither speaker-aware nor take previous utterances into account, meaning that it only classifies one utterance at a time without the speaker information (e.g., "I love you").

### Flask app

You can either run the Flask RESTful server app as a docker container or just as a python script.

1. Running the app as a docker container **(recommended)**.

   There are four images. Take what you need:

   - `docker run -it --rm -p 10006:10006 tae898/emoberta-base`
   - `docker run -it --rm -p 10006:10006 --gpus all tae898/emoberta-base-cuda`
   - `docker run -it --rm -p 10006:10006 tae898/emoberta-large`
   - `docker run -it --rm -p 10006:10006 --gpus all tae898/emoberta-large-cuda`

1. Running the app in your python environment:

   This method is less recommended than the docker one.

   Run `pip install -r requirements-deploy.txt` first.<br>
   The [`app.py`](app.py) is a flask RESTful server. The usage is below:

   ```console
   app.py [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--device DEVICE] [--model-type MODEL_TYPE]
   ```

   For example:

   ```sh
   python app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10006 --device cpu --model-type emoberta-base
   ```

### Client

Once the app is running, you can send a text to the server. First install the necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements-client.txt`, and the run the [client.py](client.py). The usage is as below:

```console
client.py [-h] [--url-emoberta URL_EMOBERTA] --text TEXT
```

For example:

```sh
python client.py --text "Emotion recognition is so cool\!"
```

will give you:

```json
{
  "neutral": 0.0049800905,
  "joy": 0.96399665,
  "surprise": 0.018937444,
  "anger": 0.0071516023,
  "sadness": 0.002021492,
  "disgust": 0.001495996,
  "fear": 0.0014167271
}
```
