This dataset has all three modalities!
Every utterance is part of a dialogue. If you also want to take the dialogue
into consideration, see utterance-ordered.json
One thing annoying about this dataset is that there are a lot of 'xxx' labels.
, which means they are 'Undecided' due to the labelers not agreeing on one thing.
If you want to see the votes, see 'undecided.json'
